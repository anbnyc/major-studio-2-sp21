### Running the app
* From this directory, run `npm run dev`
* Click "Preview running application", and open it in a new window

### Observations
* What is similar and different about the Svelte API from the Vue API?
* Look in the `/public/build/` folder. What does compiled Svelte code look like?

### Lab tasks
* Add a mechanism for users to remove a bar (for example, by double-clicking)
* Label the bars with their y-values
* When a new bar enters, transition the `update` bars to their new positions and dimensions

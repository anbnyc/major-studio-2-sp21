### Running the app

- From this directory, run `npm run serve`
- Click "Preview running application", and open it in a new window
- Add the Vue devtools browser extension

### Lab tasks

- Uncomment the media queries in App.vue and fill in the breakpoints in the media queries so the screen never looks too crowded or empty, and so we never have to scroll.
- Change the values of `grid-row` and `grid-column` in Modal.vue to lay out the content nicely.
- Experiment with different values of `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` in Header.vue. How do these change the appearance?
- Position the modal so it remains fixed on the screen even when you scroll

### Question to think on (and fix, if you figure it out)

- Why doesn't the graph in the modal have axes? What code would you change so it does?

# Major Studio 2, Spring 2021

### Labs:

#### 01-vue
_(Evening section, 2021-01-26)_

A simple SVG/D3 example using Vue (v3). Resources:
* https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#what-is-vue-js

This example is browser only -- no local development server required. We import the Vue and D3 code directly from a CDN.

#### 02-svelte
_(Evening section, 2021-01-28?)_

A simple SVG/D3 example using Svelte. Resources:
* https://svelte.dev/blog/the-easiest-way-to-get-started
* https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics

Svelte's comparative advantage is that it does as much as possible in the compile stage. As a result, we need Svelte's scripts to be running locally, and to serve the compiled version.
